This week's homework was to come up with an idea for the final project.

I am creating a database based on my current job (graduate ecologist).

My database will include tables such as canal sections (id, grid reference), surveys (i.e. id, surveyor id, date and time), plant data (i.e., section id, species), surveyor information (i.e. id, email), and section data (i.e. canal depth). 

I created an ER diagram using dbdocs to show my ideas.
