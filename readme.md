# CFG Homework

Code First Girls (CFG) is an organisation which helps women break into tech through their free courses. The @Uni Kickstarter is a 8-week long course which consists of live online classes, weekly homework, and a final project.

I enrolled onto the Data & SQL @Uni Kickstarter course as I have an interest in data analytics and coding. My interest stems from university where I used R to conduct statistical tests and to visualise data.
