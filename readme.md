# CFG Homework

Code First Girls (CFG) is an organisation that helps women break into tech through their free courses. The @Uni Kickstarter is an 8-week-long course that consists of live online classes, weekly homework, and a final project.

I enrolled in the Data & SQL @Uni Kickstarter course as I have an interest in data analytics and coding. My interest stems from my time at university, where I used R to conduct statistical tests and to visualise data.
